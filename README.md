Welcome to the NLP Learning Repository! This repository is designed for beginners who are eager to dive into the fascinating world of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Here, you'll find a curated collection of resources, tutorials, and projects to help you understand and apply NLP techniques.


## Stemming

Stemming is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to reduce words to their base or root form, removing prefixes or suffixes. This process is essential in text preprocessing, as it simplifies word variations to a common base form, reducing redundancy and enhancing computational efficiency.

The goal of stemming is to **streamline and standardize words**, making it easier for NLP tasks such as information retrieval, text mining, and machine learning. Stemming algorithms can be used to reduce inflected forms of words to their base form, making it possible to group related words together and improve the accuracy of search results.

There are different types of stemming algorithms, including the Porter stemmer, which was developed by Martin Porter and is widely used in NLP applications. The Porter stemmer is a popular choice due to its ability to handle words with complex inflections and its high accuracy.


## Lemmatization
Lemmatization is a fundamental text pre-processing technique used in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. It is a linguistic process that involves reducing words to their base or root form, known as the lemma. This is done by analyzing the grammatical category of a word (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) and providing the base form accordingly.

In lemmatization, unlike stemming, the resulting base word is referred to as a **“lemma.”** The main difference between lemmatization and stemming is that lemmatization takes into account the grammatical category of a word, whereas stemming applies simpler rules to remove prefixes and suffixes without considering the word’s grammatical category.

For example, the lemma of “running” as a verb is “run,” while as a noun, it remains “running.” Lemmatization is crucial in NLP for tasks such as text analysis, sentiment analysis, and information retrieval. It helps in standardizing words, reducing dimensionality, and improving the accuracy of language processing models.
