    "Stemming is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to reduce words to their base or root form, removing prefixes or suffixes. This process is essential in text preprocessing, as it simplifies word variations to a common base form, reducing redundancy and enhancing computational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of stemming is to streamline and standardize words, making it easier for NLP tasks such as information retrieval, text mining, and machine learning. Stemming algorithms can be used to reduce inflected forms of words to their base form, making it possible to group related words together and improve the accuracy of search results.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different types of stemming algorithms, including the Porter stemmer, which was developed by Martin Porter and is widely used in NLP applications. The Porter stemmer is a popular choice due to its ability to handle words with complex inflections and its high accuracy.\n",
